This project presents a comprehensive exploration of supervised learning using Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms applied across three real-world datasets: Adult Income, Car Evaluation, and Diabetes Prediction. The first module uses the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually based on demographic and employment features from the Adult dataset. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and 10-fold cross-validation to assess its generalization capability.

In the second module, Decision Tree classifiers are applied to the Car Evaluation dataset to classify car safety levels. Two models are trained—one using Gini index and the other using Entropy (Information Gain). A thorough performance comparison is conducted based on key evaluation metrics to determine the more effective splitting criterion.

The final module focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. A Decision Tree model is trained and optimized via hyperparameter tuning (max depth, min samples split, min samples leaf) using cross-validation. The best-performing model is evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project highlights the interpretability and adaptability of classic machine learning models in solving real-world classification problems.
